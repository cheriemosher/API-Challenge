Three observed trends related to latitude and weather conditions.

1. Temperature increased as latitude decreased because of the shape of the earth and its angle related to the sun.  Temperatures were higher (and more variable) in the southern latitudes as compared to the northern latitudes.  The southern hemisphere is currently experiencing summer, meaning the southern hemisphere is angled more towards the sun than the northern at this time of the year.

2. The three other measures (cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed) were not as obviously related to latitude.  This is due to other factors that influence these climatic features (i.e. proximity to mountains, proximity to ocean, microclimates. etc.).  

3. I expected humidity to relate to the Coriolis effect, but it wasn't obvious in the scatter plot.  There seems to be a little bit of an increase in humidity around the equator and from 30 to 60 degrees latitude above and below the equator.  Looking at the humidity for a specific date, along with microclimate variation, may add too much noise into the data.
